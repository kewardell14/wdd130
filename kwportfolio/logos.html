    <h3>Logos</h3>
      <p>
        FICTIONAL LOGO FOR AN ARCHERY STORE/RANGE (2023): This was a school assignment in which I chose a mascot and had to create a logo for a fake busisness. I chose a hawk as my mascot and created this logo for an imaginary archery store/range that specializes in custom size equipment for minors.

      <h3>Booklets</h3>
      <p>
        Hamlet Book Cover Type Design(2024)<br>I created two different book covers that are 5.5in x 8.5in based on Hamlet. One must be made of only type and one can use images. I made sure to include the name of the book and the author in both designs.<br><br>Type Book Cover: This concept focused the most on the famous line "to be or not to be." I focused on creating this tension and feeling of Hamlet fading away, as his character undergoes a massive existential crisis, as well as playing on the fading effect that alludes to the ghost of Hamlet's father.

      <p>
        Hamlet Book Cover Image Design(2024)<br>Image Book Cover: I chose to focus on the duality of the characters in the play by showing two different personalities split by a king chess piece. The story of Hamlet highlights the manipulative nature of the characters, as well as the deceit and tactics used that greatly impact the main events.

      <!-- Spend time fixing the image Booklet and then you can resubmit it as well. Done already. -->
      <p>
          GENERAL CONFERENCE BOOKLET (2024)<br>DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT: I designed a booklet based off the General Conference Talk "The Powerful Virtuous Cycle of the Doctrine of Christ" by Elder Renlund. The main focus of designing this booklet was to concentrate on hierarchy, as well as grids and overall typography. This talk has a story about kayaking so I used a blue color palette to both remind people of the story, and to convey a sense of calm. I used a wave design that I kept consistent throughout the book to convey a sense of positive momentum, which is a reoccurring theme in the talk.
