      <h3>Minor Adjustments Archery Logo<br>2023</h3>
      <p>
        This was a school assignment in which I chose a mascot and had to create a logo for a fake busisness. I chose a hawk as my mascot and created this logo for an imaginary archery store/range that specializes in custom size equipment for minors.
