        FICTIONAL LOGO FOR AN ARCHERY STORE/RANGE (2023): This was a school assignment in which I chose a mascot and had to create a logo for a fake busisness. I chose a hawk as my mascot and created this logo for an imaginary archery store/range that specializes in custom size equipment for minors.
